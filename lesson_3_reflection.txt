When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you want to work remotely or share with people working in different locations. Also works as a remote backup of your work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    For the same reason you commit manually... consistency and logic.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    fork: a special kind of clone (copy of a repository) only done through GitHub
    clone: a copy of a repository, either local or remote
    branch: used to keep a working version (master) while being able to try new stuff (branch).

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    You know that that was the last shared version, so you can work with it off-line and combine your changes when you go online again.
